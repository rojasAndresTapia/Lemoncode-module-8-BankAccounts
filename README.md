# Bank Accounts

This javascript exercise displays a list of bank accounts:

There is a file with two objects:

- One with the owner detail.
- Another with the accounts and their details

Both are related through the account property "clientId".

All the html is created dynamically with javascript.

Also a function is created to show the balances in red if they are negative.
